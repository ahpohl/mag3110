\section Background

The MAG3110 library has been derived from the Sparkfun Arduino library and ported to C++ to allow embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi with an I<sup>2</sup>C bus to use the breakout board directly. It uses much of the same API as the original library. However, a couple of methods have been renamed, added or removed. The source code can be downloaded from the MAG3110 GitHub repository including some basic examples to get you started.

Freescaleâ€™s MAG3110 is a small, low-power, digital 3-axis magnetometer. The device can be used in conjunction with a 3-axis accelerometer to realize an orientation independent electronic compass that can provide accurate heading information. It features a standard I<sup>2</sup>C serial interface output and is capable of measuring magnetic fields with an output data rate (ODR) up to 80 Hz; these output data rates correspond to sample intervals from 12.5 ms to several seconds. For details see the technical reference documentation.
